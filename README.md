# hello-world
File for ideas,resources,etc
This file is new because all of the files I had in affiliation with WWU have been deleted.
That's okay though. I intend to visit and contribute on Github on a regualr basis to learn as much as I possibly can.
Thanks for looking at this file. More to come soon.
